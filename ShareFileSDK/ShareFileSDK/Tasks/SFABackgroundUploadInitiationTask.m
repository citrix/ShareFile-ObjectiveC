    // of the new task(redirection task). Since user only interacts with root level task it is better for only root level task
    // to make and resume URL Session Upload Task, since then we do not need to worry about need of cancelling the URL Session Task if root task
    // was cancelled in-between.
    // Alternate 2) Make redirection tasks of type SFAHttpTask. But SFABackgroundUploadInitiationTask is same as SFAHttpTask without backgroundUploadInitiationTaskDelegate
    // Making redirection task of type:SFAHttpTask would have required copy/paste code. Which we avoided here.
    // Hence for redirection tasks backgroundUploadInitiationTaskDelegate will not be set and only root level task will be able to intiate URL Session Task.
